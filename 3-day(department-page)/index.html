            <h1>Our Department</h1>
            <p class="depart-para">West Godavari Institute of science and engineering has started Mechanical Engineering Department with UG Program BTech in year 2009, with the initial intake of 60.

                The Department of Mechanical Engineering from the day of its inception, has been taking long strides in the field of science and Engineering.
                 One of the oldest and active Departments anticipated the rapid developments in technology and software and provided the most sophisticated 
                 laboratory facilities & excellent infrastructure. The Department has well qualified dedicated enthusiastic teaching & technical staff.
                It is a discipline that finds wide scope in emerging areas like CAD, CAM, CIM, Robotics, Mechatronics and Renewable Energy etc. 
                The Department is provided with state-of-the-art laboratories and workshops. The students of our Department have good communication and Inter personal skills.
                The department has very good infrastructure facilities, well ventilated classrooms, laboratories and advanced and licensed software facilities. Some of the laboratories 
                are kept open beyond college hours to facilitate more time in experiential learning and student project works. Utilizing these facilities students regularly
                 participate in professional body activities like ASME-HPVC and SAE Baja and win prizes. Students are encouraged to improve their innovative skills. As a result, 
                 some of the students’ projects were converted into products.</p>
